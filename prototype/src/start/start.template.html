        <h1>What this project is about</h1>
        <p>In this learning project, I test various technologies, which help me build a rather complex webapp
            prototype. The webapp is based on AngularJS (for now).</p>
        <p>The basic ideas of this webapp are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reuse as much as possible instead of reinventing.</li>
            <li>Be lean by reusing what is available and apply basic patterns and practices.</li>
            <li>Do not just use a technology to be cool - use it the right way.</li>
            <li>Learn from mistakes and do it better next time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Though, the content of the webapp itself will not crave your attention, the setup of it will. It uses</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a lean but stable ES6+ modularized project setup,</li>
            <li>Webpack as a bundler,</li>
            <li>Babel as a JavaScript "compiler",</li>
            <li>Karma and Jasmine for a unit test environment,</li>
            <li>AngularJS, UI-Router and AngularJS Material as the base of the ui,</li>
        </ul>
