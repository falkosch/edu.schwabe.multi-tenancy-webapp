# Base-App

Contains the all app functionality shared by all tenant apps, i.e. base JS logic and SCSS for common UI elements such as spinners.

## How to Use

You need to run the test scripts at the repository's root using `npx lerna run ...`, f.e.:

- Run unit tests watcher with `/<repository-root>$ npx lerna run test --stream --no-prefix --scope */*base-app`

See the README.md at the repository's root for more instructions.
